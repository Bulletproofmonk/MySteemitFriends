# MySteemitFriends

A tool to analyse your upvote statistics for Steemit. Each file in this project will be explained in detail below.

- **index.php**: The main page for the tool. Enter your user name and click the button to see the statistical results who has upvoted you as well as who you have upvoted in table for a side by side comparison. You can then set filters and ordering methods with dropdowns and textboxes (e.g. time period, whether to exclude comment upvotes, rank by number of votes, total weight or total weight * Steem Power).
